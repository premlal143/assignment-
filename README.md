1.     :  What is Software?
Ans :
            Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.

The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

Other types of software include programming software, which provides the programming tools software developers need; middleware, which sits between system software and applications; and driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals.

Early software was written for specific computers and sold with the hardware it ran on. In the 1980s, software began to be sold on floppy disks, and later on CDs and DVDs. Today, most software is purchased and directly downloaded over the internet. Software can be found on vendor websites or application service provider websites.




2.     :  What are the types of Applications?                                        
Ans : 
     		What are applications?
Applications also referred to as apps are created to execute specific tasks on computers or mobile devices. It runs inside the operating system of the device used to open it. Understanding what an application is and its types are crucial to using it effectively for your business processes.

With an array of choices available, we have broadly classified applications based on needs or specific use cases. 

Different types of applications
Apps serve different purposes and needs depending on individual organizations and industries. They’re helpful across healthcare, banking, education, travel, retail, logistics, etc. The primary purpose of every application is to simplify a specific operation or help users get something done more effectively. 

Today, users have a plethora of apps at their disposal, and they can determine which ones to use based on their requirements.

The following are the different types of applications based on need:

Database apps
Custom apps
Web-based apps
Low code apps
No code apps
Enterprise apps



3.     :  What is programing?
Ans :
		Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. 

Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples: 

When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase, programming allows you to interact with the site’s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus.

The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease. 

Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things. 

Space exploration is made possible through programming.



4.     :  What is Python?
Ans :
		Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.
